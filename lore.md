## Magic
Magic in the world is governed by two forces; chaos and order. **Chaos** is the bundling of entropy and energy; through energy production, entropy ensures that things break down, that time flows forward, that cause and effect are linear. **Order** is the steady state of all things; the resistance to energy and change.

### Chaos and Order
Chaos and Order are closely bound; Chaos breaks down all things, striving for the goal of a simple, stable, Orderly base state. Order is also the state of all things before Chaos takes hold; Order is the alpha and the omega, but is nothing without Chaos. Rock and ice and steel are Order; heat and force and light are Chaos.

All plant and animal **Life** forms at the crossroads of Chaos and Order; the struggle of Order born in the midst of Chaos. In a similar way, **Fire**, **Water** and **Wind** are also the balance between Chaos and Order.

### Magic in Humans
Some humans are better attuned to the forces of Chaos and Order, sometimes one or the other, sometimes where they cross. Those who can truly harness magic must keep their arts secret, lest the superstition of their fellows turn against them, unless their position as a religious figure provides them with a level of protection. Others choose a life of seclusion, such as the hag in the swamp, who barters with spirits; or the druid of the forest, he who communes with all creatures, both natural and Fae.

## Deities
Chaos and Order are _not_ good and evil; the powerful Chaos god, **Eos**, brings light and warmth to the land from dawn until dusk; her counterpart **Soma** is the moon, ever stable, even as **Rahu**, goddess of shadow, tussles with him across the sky. These gods are known by other names, but they are common among known nations.

Lesser gods tend to be more regional, and may or may not have equivalents in other cultures. Lesser gods may be a child of one or more of the main three, such as the **Atar**, god of fire, son of Eos, or personify some aspect of living things or natural forces, like **WÃ¶d**, god of wind, or **Sif**, goddess of the forest. Many cultures see **Allani**, the goddess of decay and death, as the final state of Order, the guardian of all things final.

The most common **creation myth** is that plants and animals are the children of Eos and **Uar (Crom)**, god of the Earth, with Man being both the youngest and the closest to the gods. Uar is the most powerful god of Order, but after his union with Eos he slumbers, oblivious to the lives of gods or men.

### Power of Prayer
Truly devout worshippers may manifest the power of their gods in subtle ways, or at least appear to; this may represent true blessings from a deity, or may simply be the manifestation of one truly concerned with a particular outcome, adding incantations and prayers as part of the physical and mental work being invested. The end result is the same; in this world, prayer increase the chances of success for those who believe. That said, some gods listen better than others.

## Spirits
Spirits are the remnants of the interactions of Deities, and take many forms. Some are tied to a specific location, such as a river spirit, born of a powerful confluence of water and earth, or a specter haunting a tomb, a human who was denied eternal rest by Allani. Others are more corporeal, such as Man, and also the Fae; the fairies and changelings and trolls that live just outside of man's peripheral vision, many of whom are the children of Soma and Sif.

## The World
Eos lies somewhere in the Age of Steel. Our opening scene is a small farming village, surrounded by gently rolling hills interspersed with small streams, foot-bridges, and the occasional orchard. On the eastern horizon lie a mountain range, fronted by steep foothills with tracts of dark forest, largely untamed by man.
